### 🧃 Personal Motto
> *Turning medical complexity into technological simplicity — one project at a time.*

> ⚠️ **Why I build clinical AI**
> After working as a doctor, I realized that most digital tools are made for administrators, not clinicians.
> My goal is to build intelligent systems that actually improve decision-making at the bedside.
